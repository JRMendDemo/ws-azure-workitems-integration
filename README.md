graph TD
Product_1 --> Project_1
Product_1 --> Project_2
Product_1 --> Project_3
Product_2 --> Project_4
Product_2 --> Project_5
Product_2 --> Project_6
```  
If you want to include to sync process all projects of Product_1 and Project_5 and Project_6 from Product_2 then you parameters should be  
wsproducts = Product_1  
wsprojects = Project_5, Project_6  
**This configuration is equal of the such scheme:**  
wsproducts =   
wsprojects = Project_1, Project_2, Project_3, Project_5, Project_6  

5. **synctime** is time period in **MINUTES** for running sync process in **synctime** minutes
   1. Not recommended setting the value less than 20 minutes
6. **syncrun** is True or False. **True** means run synchronization in **synctime** minutes
